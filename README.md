# Machine-learning
This repository contains all the Machine Learning Projects that I've done so far and will be used to store all the related projects that I will work on in the future.
A Short Briefing on Machine Learning :--------
  - As Machine Learning continues to emerge as a popular study there's a high rush among people in Technical field especially students to build their career in this field.
  - Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 
  - Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
  - Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.

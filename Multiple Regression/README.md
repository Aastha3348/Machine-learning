# Multiple Regression
This file consists of the source code of Multiple Regression Model along with the explanation and csv.

## Here's what you need to know about Multiple Regression
  - <B> Multiple regression </B> is an extension of simple linear regression in which multiple independent variables are used to estimate a dependent variable.
  - In other words multiple linear regression analysis helps us to understand how much the dependent variable changes when we change the independent variables.
### Applications 
  - Predicting impacts of changes
  - To find the relationships between interacting wave modes that may be characterized by different frequencies.
  - It is a </B>Statistical technique </B> that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable.
 
  ### Steps to build the model :
    Step 1. Import the libraries and the data set.
    
    Step 2. Feature Selection
    
    Step 3. Select the predictor and target variables
    
    Step 4. Initial prediction using logistic function
    
    Step 5. Normalize the data
    
    Step 6. model fitting
    
    Step 7. Accuracy report with test data

Here the approach that I've used for <B> Model Evaluation </B> is Train and Test on the same dataset. 
Train the model on the entire dataset and then test it using a portion of the same dataset.
